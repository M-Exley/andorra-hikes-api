## these are the notes from the original idea

- These are the hikes in Andorra. I have them as individual leaflets but it would be good to search for them by difficulty and area.
- At the moment you just search by number.
- Time, distance and elevation gain and loss needs to be added for more interactivity.
- The final goal is to get the requested data using Promises in JS.
- For example, I want to do a hike in Encamp and I want something under two hours but difficult ('blue' or 'red').
- There will also be a selection for 'circular' or not, meaning that the trail is based on a loop that ends where it started and not by using the same trail to descend.

## to improve - 11th March 2025

- capability to save hikes to favourites and toggle done etc.; add to to-do
- figure out the best way to get the hikes from local JSON file
- utilise innerHTML more
- use ID from the beginning. The hikes do actually come with a number...
- SORT function
- images are not really of concern here but maybe a carousel would be good
- clean HTML design with nice clear transitions and search fields
- randomise button!!

## this project is about using promises and async/ await construction to retrieve and display my own data

## I would really like to host the data somewhere as if it were a real API

- add map with current location request?
